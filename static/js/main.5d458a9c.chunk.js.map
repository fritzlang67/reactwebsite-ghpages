Dezember 1963 brach auf dem griechischen Kreuzfahrtschiff LAKONIA 180 Meilen nordwestlich von Madeira ein Feuer aus. Löschversuche der<br />\nBesatzung scheiterten, so dass sich der Brand schnell ausbreitete. An Bord befanden sich 1036 Menschen. Nachdem die LAKONIA S.O.S. gefunkt hatte, trafen rund drei Stunden später die ersten Schiffe zur Rettung der 651 Passagiere und 385 Besatzungsmitglieder der LAKONIA ein. Obwohl genügend Rettungsboote vorhanden waren, fanden mindestens 131 Menschen bei dem<br />\nSchiffsunglück den Tod. Von den 385 Besatzungsmitgliedern der LAKONIA waren über 50 in Bremerhaven angeheuert worden. Die meisten davon arbeiteten als Servicepersonal auf der LAKONIA.
